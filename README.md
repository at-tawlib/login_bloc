# Basic Login app with BLOC module and RxDart
(Dart and Flutter: The Complete Developer's Guide Tutorials by Stephen Grider)

- We use blocs instead of StatefulWidgets to share information around our app
- We can use bloc either as a single global instance or with scoped instance
- Blocs use sinks and streams to work with information
- Widgets use StreamBuilders to change their contents depending on values coming through a stream
- The RxDart library is extremely useful in the vast majority of apps
